# Introduction
General codes for DSGE perturbation. Includes methods for occasionally binding constraints, Bayesian simulation and continuous time (though likely covering only simple cases).

There is a manual explaining the different functions at manual/manual.pdf. Example codes can be found at \url{https://github.com/c-d-cotton/dsge-perturbation-examples/}.

# Setup
Run setup_submodules.sh to add in required submodules.
